# Braedan Mitchell's Project 1: Soul Purpose Games demo site

## The rundown
 This is a website for the fictional game development site of **Soul Purpose Games**. The website is comprised of **7** pages:
 - home (gives a basic welcome to the user as well as a quick explanation of the pages.)
 - games (shows a game that currently exists within the fictional universe where this exists)
 - coming soon (shows a game that is about to come out)
 - about (gives a brief overview of the company and its history)
 - team (introduses the people involved in the company)
 - contact (provides a way for different kinds of people to get in contact with us)
 - merch (shows merchandise that the users can buy)


## How to use the site

### Navigation
 You can navigate around the website using the **menu** bar near the top of every page. When the page is small enough you can use the *three lines* in the menu to expand it. Upon expansion (or just when viewed normally) you will notice that whatever page you are on will have its corrisponding button in the menu disabled. 
 - (to close the menu when viewed on mobile or small window press the *three lines* again)

### contact page
 The only other area of note is the contact page. If you are on that page you will see three forms with two boxes (one for name and one for the question) and a sumbit button for each.
 - the first form is for questions regarding a game or upcoming release specifically
 - the second form is for buisness inquiries
 - the third form is for any other questions that are not related to the other two.

## tech used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap

## future ideas
 - actually making the contact forms send the form questions somewhere.
 - adding a the rest of the merch page (lol)
 - possibly making a place where people can make donations
 - if doing events adding a page where those events can be shown
    - adding to the last one a way to place an event banner above the page
    - holiday themes

## user stories

2. as a supportive fan, I want a place stay updated about new releases for my favorite games!
3. as an intruiged buisness offical, I want a way to easily contact this company for possible colaborations.
